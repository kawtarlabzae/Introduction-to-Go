## main.go

This file serves as the entry point of the application, configuring and starting an HTTP server with various routes for managing customers, authors, books, orders, and sales reports.

### Key Features

1. **Data Initialization**:
   - Initializes JSON files for persistence:
     - Customers
     - Authors
     - Books
     - Orders
   - Ensures data is loaded into in-memory stores at startup.

2. **Sales Report Generation**:
   - Periodically generates sales reports every 24 hours.
   - Provides an endpoint to trigger report generation manually.

3. **Router Setup**:
   - Configures routes for managing resources such as customers, authors, books, and orders using the `httprouter` package.

4. **Graceful Shutdown**:
   - Handles termination signals (e.g., `SIGTERM`) to allow the server to shut down gracefully.
